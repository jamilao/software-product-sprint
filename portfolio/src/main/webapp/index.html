        This summer, Jamila will be working on a passion project with a group of Duke students. The project, commonly referred to as the Duke University Phoenix Project, is a new tech internship program designed to provide students who lost their jobs due to the pandemic with the opportunity to work on impactful projects in software engineering, machine learning, and data science. Jamila spent the spring semester organizing the program and is a member of the founding group of the Phoenix Project which currently serves over 200 students across 80+ projects.
